termometr
=========

# Main

This is a demo firmware for Atmel AVR ATMega16 for working with DS1820 termometr sensor.

This project was started to learn atmel controller but growed to usefull thing that
I use for home termomert with three sensors, on room, balcony and outdoor.

Because I wanted to learn atmel, I haven't use any libraries to work with LCD and ds1820.
If you found any bugs in my code, please don't hit me much :) 

The next functions are implemented:
- 1wire interface protocol (search, read, write)
- text output to LCD display based on HD44780 chip
- text output to UART (output only)
